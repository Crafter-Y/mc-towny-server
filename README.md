# mc-towny-server

proof of concept docker-compose deployment for a towny server network

## Lobby

An empty lobby world should already get created.

You can use any lobby world by exchanging the worlds/lobby world.
The lobby gets automatically resetted on every restart.

You can create a Server NPC by using `/npc create`

You might use a `//wand` to select your spawn, `//expand vert` and `/region create spawn` to prevent building
